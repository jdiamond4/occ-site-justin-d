            <div class="about-creator-content">
                <p>Since middle school, I’ve volunteered for The Apostles’ House, a community group in Newark, NJ, that helps families transition from homelessness to independent living. Through spending time there, I learned that communication with the residents had been challenging for the staff. Stapling weekly calendars and announcements on a bulletin board in the lobby was not cutting it. Given my deep interest in computer science and technology, I was eager to help them find a solution, but there wasn't one that existed. That’s when I met with the president of The Apostles’ House and decided to build an app called Our Community Connects, which can help groups – from homeless shelters, to college dorms, to sports teams – connect. Taking this project from idea to reality has been exciting, and given me a great exposure to social impact tech, which I look forward to doing more of in the future.</p>
