                    <p>Our Community Connects is an innovative mobile solution to aid in communication within an organization or living community. This all-in-one app allows a group administrator to manage and alert members of upcoming events through the live calendar and announcements with custom notifications to keep all members in the loop at all times.

                    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                    <p>The vision of Our Community Connects is to bring together members of any type of community under one application for cohesive, stress-free community management. Whether it be a living community or a business, the user-friendly interface ensures that both administrators and members have a seamless experience communicating with one another. Assuming bulletin boards and signs attract attention or that anyone wants to go through junk mail for information just doesn't work. Using this powerful app puts alerts right onto phone screens, ensuring all communication reaches users.</p>

                    <h3>Who needs Our Community Connects?</h3>
                    <p>Our goal is to make connecting easy. So if you are:</p>
                    <ul class="community-list">
                        <li>Living Groups (shelters, college dorms, apartment houses, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Businesses</li>
                        <li>Local Schools</li>
                        <li>Sports Teams</li>
                        <li>Clubs and Volunteer Groups</li>
                        <li>Religious Groups</li>
                        <li>and the list goes on!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These groups share similar needs: they must connect – for practices, meetings, fundraisers, and much more. Our easy-to-schedule calendar makes sure group members are informed of upcoming events, and should plans change, our real-time notification service means a quick alert can go out.</p>
